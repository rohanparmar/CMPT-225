# A string is to be constructed using only the characters 'A' and 'B'.
# Given four integers, countA, countB, maxA and maxB, the constructed string
# is said to be optimal if:
# 1) It contains at most countA 'A' characters and exactly countB 'B' characters.
# 2) Each substring of only 'A' characters has length at most maxA.
# 3) Each substring of only 'B' characters has length at most maxB.
# Example:
# countA = 3, countB = 5, maxA = 1, maxB = 1
# The maximal optimal string is "BABABAB" whose length is 7.
# Thus, the function should return 7.

def getOptimalStringLength(countA, countB, maxA, maxB):
    # Your code here
    for i in range(countA):
        for j in range(countB):
            if i*maxA + j*maxB <= countA + countB:
                return i*maxA + j*maxB
            else:
                return 0
